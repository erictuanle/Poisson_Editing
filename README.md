Poisson Seamless Cloning
========================
Algorithm coded from the lecture of Jean-Michel Morel (École normale supérieure de Cachan), and the article "Poisson Image Editing" (J. Matias Di Martino, Gabriele Facciolo & Enric Meinhardt-Llopis).

==
Research studies led to conclude that humans were more sensitive to the Laplacian rather than the image itself. Therefore, seamless editing boils down to solve Poisson equation. The article "Poisson Image Editing" introduced a Fast Fourier solution to solve the Poisson equation with Neuman border condition.

==
An example can be launched by running the Main.m script.
